        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I was raised in Virginia for a time and North Carolina, and continue to reside in North Carolina today. I took my first programming lessons at the age of 9 and it was because of my teacher in these lessons that I continue to harbor a fondness for programming today. I also got the opportunity to find out how hard game design and programming is after starting and scrapping multiple "games" 10% through...</p>
        <p>There were many moments that I felt that I would never be a proper programmer. There were times where I failed certifications, got stuck on easy problems for hours without making any progress, and just felt hopeless and unwilling to work, but it's thanks to my family and peers that I was able to power through these struggles and continue to walk on the road towards college and a programming job to this day.</p>
        <p>My hope for the future is to save money and eventually run my own programming company. If I'm unable to do that, I'm happy with just making a site filled with tools that people need but are spread out across multiple sites and could use consolidating. Outside of my career, I hope to remain in North Carolina for the foreseeable future.</p>
